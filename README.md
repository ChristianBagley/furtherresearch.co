## Current webpage for FurtherResearch.co.

- Website is built using Jekyll, a Ruby static site generator, which has been modified/customized where necessary. 

- We use [Netlify](netlify.com) to automate the build and deploy process. [Netlify](netlify.com) also provides us with a CDN and SSL certificates for the domain and relevant subdomains on the site. 

- In the near future, we intend on migrating from Jekyll to [Hugo](gohugo.io) (Go) as our base for the website, mostly due to the speed of the platform and extendability. Though, we still love and use Jekyll for other platforms we work on.  

- More information about FurtherResearch.co - the goals, mission, overview, etc... will be provided here in the README.md soon. We are still working on structuring everything though, so the repo is a it sparse. For the time being, refer to the website itself for any information and updates you're looking for.
